## Description

## Format/Pages Necessary

### Home Page
  * A calendar that can be touched/clicked
  * An RSSfeed of changes to any of your events since you last logged in

### Profile Page
  * Picture/Name/Etc.
  * A list of events you are a part of

### Event Page
  * Picture, Title
  * Where, When, Start Time, End Time

### Settings Page



## Features

  * Admin verification

... All attendees can make changes to event name, date, time, and whereabouts, but only admins of each event can approve those changes. 

  * RSS feed

... Every page comes with an automatic subscription to the RSS feed that allows for updates on every change within the event, especially RSVP changes
... You can "mute" events to unsubscribe so they don't get push notifications 

  * Push Notifications 
... all RSVP changes, event changes, etc
